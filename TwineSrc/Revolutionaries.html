C: Urgh, I&#39;m exhausted. At least we don&#39;t have to worry about what to have. 
V: All hail the great leader. 
C: Have you seen Fabiene or Gabriel today?
V: I believe they will be in for dinner, but I&#39;ve not seen them much during the day. I think Fabiene said Gabriel just got a new job. 

*Kitchen Sounds*

F: Hey, how&#39;s tricks?
G: Tricks are tricky. 
F: After dinner?
G: Sure:
V: Ah there you two are, you coming to dinner?
G: Yeah, sorry we haven&#39;t been more help, Faibene just god a new job.
V: Oh really, I thought... never mind, how&#39;s it going Fabiene?
F: Yeah it&#39;s fine, bit tedious at the moment, you know how new jobs are
V: Not really man, since my Mum was imprisoned no one will interview me. 
F:...
C: Dinner is in 5, Verusha, can you come chop some vegetables?
V: Coming. 

*Kitchen Sounds*

C: Dinner is served!
V: Ahh more potatoe soup from our esteemed leaders.
C: Don&#39;t start that again
V: Your cooking is of course superb, but there is only so much you can do wit potatoes and water, right Fabienne?
F: Huh? Yes, it looks great Chryseis. 
V: Tired Fabiene? 
F: Uhh yes, long day at..
V: Well I&#39;m tired of this nonsense goventment, they tell us that supplies are short, but I tell you our esteemed leader looks fatter every day. 
G: Don&#39;t say such things Verusha!
C: Come on everyone, dig in, it won&#39;t get better if it is colder. 

*Eating sounds*

F: Can we be excused?
C: Err sure...
G: Thanks. 

*Clattering of chairs*

C: That was... unlike them.
V: You mean rude, the word your looking for is rude. Come on, I&#39;ll do the washing if you do the drying. 

*Running water*
