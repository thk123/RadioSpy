F: (muffled) who is it?
R: It&#39;s Rachel from downstairs
F: Who?
R: The nanny... I work for Adrienne and Marcel?
F: Oh, right, (door opens) sorry, I didn&#39;t recognise you.
R: Recognise me?
F: Through the peep hole, I didn&#39;t recognise you.
R: Well, I didn&#39;t have my Mary Poppins mask on so...
F: Sorry, do come in.
A: Who is it?
F: Rachel, the nanny from Adrienne and Marcel&#39;s 
A: Ah 
G: Cool 
A: Oh
R: Hey everyone, I&#39;m Rachel. I just wanted to come by and invite you to a party I&#39;ve arranged for Marcel and Adrienne to celebrate their 15th anniversary.
A: Weird, why would they want a bunch of people at their anniversary, doesn&#39;t sound very romantic.
R: They love to share.
A:O-K...
A: Sounds cool - we like parties, when is it.
R: 31st March
G: So in 3 weeks.
R: Yup
F: Sure, okay, we&#39;ll be there. What time does it start.
R: 7.30 
A: Great
R: Okay wonderful, it&#39;s a date. I&#39;d better go back downstairs, Marcel will be wondering where I am. (door closes) [[The aide, Adrienne, comes home from work at {The Crawley Building}.

Said he wanted to talk to me about something. I&#39;ll just stick our dinner in the microwave (sound of her doing this) Hey Rachel, how has Ben been today?
R: He&#39;s been great. He had quite a long nap earlier. Even the hamsters going round on the wheel didn&#39;t wake him.
M: Yes, those hamsters were at it again. They seem to have a lot of energy these days.
R: Quite the gymnasts.
A: Oh - maybe I should oil the wheel?
M: Oh, I&#39;m sure the wheel can take it. 
R: Yes, I hope so. I&#39;ve changed their bedding so you needn&#39;t worry about that this evening.
M: Thanks Rachel, they can make quite a mess of it when Adrienne&#39;s out.
R: Mmm, yes they can. Is it hot in here?
M: I&#39;m getting a bit hot
A: It&#39;s cold out and the windows are open. Perhaps you&#39;re coming down with something... 
A: So how&#39;s the knitting coming along Rachel?
R: Knitting? OH, yes. All good, all the different colours are coming together nicely, I&#39;ve set myself a deadline of the 31st March.
A: 31st March sounds good. I look forward to seeing it.
R: [[You&#39;ll love it, really.]]

<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="what will we do if she gets the job?" tags="" position="307,154">A: There are plenty of nannies out there. (microwave pings) Sit down, dinner is ready (sound of plates and cutlery being fetched and laid on the table).
c: Hmm.
A: So should I go have coffee with Fabian?
M: God no! You should stay away from them, you&#39;ve no idea what else they could be mixed up with.
A: Oh don&#39;t be silly - he really wanted to - I&#39;ll go.
M: (nervously) You don&#39;t want to end up addicted to crack.
A: Crack? Why would I end up addicted to crack. Your humour is really weird Marcel. 
M: Sometimes I go a bit far when I let my thoughts run away with me.
A: Indeed. That&#39;s weird...
M: What&#39;s weird?
A: The hamster cage doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s been cleaned at all, maybe Rachel is getting sloppy. That&#39;s not like her...
M: No... maybe she&#39;s distracted.
A: With the interview prep.
M: Sure, the interview prep.
A: I&#39;ll call a few agencies tomorrow to see what nannies will be available if Rachel gets the job.
M: I guess we will need a new nanny if Rachel really has to go. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="You&#39;ll love it, really." tags="" position="182,154">R: Well I&#39;d better be going. I&#39;ve got to prepare for an interview at {The Crawley Building} tomorrow.
M: You&#39;re leaving us?! You didn&#39;t say. Oh. What will we do without you?! This isn&#39;t right. We&#39;ve just started to get into a really good rhythm. You should stay Rachel, I&#39;d like you to stay... for little Ben.
A: Jeez Marcel, what gives? Don&#39;t worry about him, Rachel, I&#39;m so glad you&#39;ve got a shot at this. {The Crawley Building} would be lucky to have you as an intern.
R: Thanks Adrienne, without you I&#39;d never have gotten an interview.
M: Don&#39;t be modest, you&#39;re so great at looking after the needs of others. I
R: Well, goodbye!
A: Bye Rachel - good luck! (door closes)
M: We&#39;re so lucky to have her, [[what will we do if she gets the job?]]</tw-passagedata>

M: Young people these days! They&#39;re probably stoned! 
R: (laughs nervously) yeah, stoned! [[(more nervous laughter)]]</tw-passagedata>
