F: who is it?
R: It&#39;s Rachel from downstairs
F: Who?
R: The nanny... I work for Adrienne and Marcel?
F: Oh, right, sorry, I didn&#39;t recognise you.
R: Recognise me?
F: Through the peep hole, I didn&#39;t recognise you.
R: Well, I didn&#39;t have my Mary Poppins mask on so...
F: Sorry, do come in.
L: Who is it?
F: Rachel, the nanny from Adrienne and Marcel&#39;s 
L: Ah 
G: Cool 
L: Oh
R: Hey everyone, I&#39;m Rachel. I just wanted to come by and invite you to a party I&#39;ve arranged for Marcel and Adrienne to celebrate their 15th anniversary.
L: Weird, why would they want a bunch of people at their anniversary, doesn&#39;t sound very romantic.
R: They love to share.
L: OK...
L: Sounds cool - we like parties, when is it.
R: 31st March
G: So in 3 weeks.
R: Yup
F: Sure, okay, we&#39;ll be there. What time does it start.
R: 7:30 
L: Great
R: Okay wonderful, it&#39;s a date. I&#39;d better go back downstairs, Marcel will be wondering where I am. (door closes) [[1.2:LivingRoom]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="1.2:LivingRoom" tags="" position="307,4">A: Hey you, (the noise of her kissing Marcel) that weird guy Fabian just spoke to me in the hallway, invited me for coffee next week. Said he wanted to talk to me about something. I&#39;ll just stick our dinner in the microwave (sound of her doing this) Hey Rachel, how has Ben been today?
R: He&#39;s been great. He had quite a long nap earlier. Even the hamsters going round on the wheel didn&#39;t wake him.
M: Yes, those hamsters were at it again. They seem to have a lot of energy these days.
R: Quite the gymnasts.
A: Oh - maybe I should oil the wheel?
M: Oh, I&#39;m sure the wheel can take it. 
R: Yes, I hope so. I&#39;ve changed their bedding so you needn&#39;t worry about that this evening.
M: Thanks Rachel, they can make quite a mess of it when Adrienne&#39;s out.
R: Mmm, yes they can. Is it hot in here?
M: I&#39;m getting a bit hot
A: It&#39;s cold out and the windows are open. Perhaps you&#39;re coming down with something... 
A: So how&#39;s the knitting coming along Rachel?
R: Knitting? OH, yes. All good, all the different colours are coming together nicely, I&#39;ve set myself a deadline of the 31st March.
A: 31st March sounds good. I look forward to seeing it.

<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="1.4:LivingRoom" tags="" position="307,154">A: There are plenty of nannies out there. (microwave pings) Sit down, dinner is ready (sound of plates and cutlery being fetched and laid on the table).
M: Hmm.
A: So should I go have coffee with Fabian?
M: God no! You should stay away from them, you&#39;ve no idea what else they could be mixed up with.
A: Oh don&#39;t be silly - he really wanted to - I&#39;ll go.
M: (nervously) You don&#39;t want to end up addicted to crack.
A: Crack? Why would I end up addicted to crack. Your humour is really weird Marcel. 
M: Sometimes I go a bit far when I let my thoughts run away with me.
A: Indeed. That&#39;s weird...
M: What&#39;s weird?
A: The hamster cage doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s been cleaned at all, maybe Rachel is getting sloppy. That&#39;s not like her...
M: No... maybe she&#39;s distracted.
A: With the interview prep.
M: Sure, the interview prep.
A: I&#39;ll call a few agencies tomorrow to see what nannies will be available if Rachel gets the job.
M: I guess we will need a new nanny if Rachel really has to go. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="1.3:LivingRoom" tags="" position="182,154">R: Well I&#39;d better be going. I&#39;ve got to prepare for an interview at {The Crawley Building} tomorrow.
M: You&#39;re leaving us?! You didn&#39;t say. Oh. What will we do without you?! This isn&#39;t right. We&#39;ve just started to get into a really good rhythm. You should stay Rachel, I&#39;d like you to stay... for little Ben.
A: Jeez Marcel, what gives? Don&#39;t worry about him, Rachel, I&#39;m so glad you&#39;ve got a shot at this. {The Crawley Building} would be lucky to have you as an intern.
R: Thanks Adrienne, without you I&#39;d never have gotten an interview.
M: Don&#39;t be modest, you&#39;re so great at looking after the needs of others. I
R: Well, goodbye!
A: Bye Rachel - good luck! (door closes)
M: We&#39;re so lucky to have her, what will we do if she gets the job?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="5" name="1.5:LivingRoom" tags="" position="583,66">A: Oh - I had a very strange conversation with some of those young people from across the way. If they were suggesting what I think they were suggesting then I&#39;m not sure what to do. 
M: Young people these days! They&#39;re probably stoned! 
R: (laughs nervously) yeah, stoned! [[(more nervous laughter)]]</tw-passagedata>
