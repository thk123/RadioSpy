Welcome to RadioTap
You've had a tip from a source
of an assassination plot against 
The Leader, Officer.
You have been
assigned to  
find the perpertrators and
eliminate all threats.

We've tapped three houses.
We need you to listen in to the conversations
and decide whether or not to 
make an arrest within 3 days.

The Leader must be protected at all costs.
The assailants must be found!
It is up to you now, Good luck Officer.
