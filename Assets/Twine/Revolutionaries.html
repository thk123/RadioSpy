C: Have you seen Fabiene or Gabriel today?
V: I believe they will be in for dinner, but I&#39;ve not seen them much during the day. I think Fabiene said Gabriel just got a new job. 
C: By the way, did you get a chance to sort out the present?
V: For the party?
C: Yeah - I got the call, it&#39;s on. 
V: Oh great, are Gabriel and Fabiene getting involved.
C: I don&#39;t think so. Can you pick it up tomorrow, I still think the ruby idea is the best one. 
V: Sure thing, I&#39;ll make sure I&#39;m not being followed!
